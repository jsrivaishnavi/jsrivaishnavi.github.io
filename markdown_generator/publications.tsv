2023-10-25	CSP-LSTM Based Emotion Recognition from EEG Signals	2023 IEEE International Conference on Metrology for eXtended Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Neural Engineering (MetroXRAINE)	Emotion recognition from the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is a growing area of research in the field of neuroscience and medical technology. The ability to accurately identify and classify emotions can have significant implications for various applications, including the diagnosis and treatment of emotional disorders, human-computer interaction, etc. A deep learning-based emotion identification method is proposed here. The EEG data is divided into four frequency bands (alpha, beta, lower gamma and upper gamma) using a temporal domain filter, and then the common spatial pattern (CSP) feature extraction is applied to obtain a set of discriminative features that are used to train the long short-term memory (LSTM) for emotion classification. The LSTM was trained for each band and the predictions of each of these models (same architecture with different weights) were combined using a majority voting classifier (MVC) method. All subjects achieved accuracy values exceeding 90%, resulting in a mean accuracy of 97.34% when considering the average across all subjects. The utilisation of this method for bio-signal modeling and interpretation has the capability to enhance the identification and management of emotional disorders. etc. 	J. T. Panachakel, R. H, S. P.

2023-03-03	EEG-based Emotion Classification-A Theoretical Perusal of Deep Learning Methods	2023 2nd International Conference for Innovation in Technology (INOCON)	Human emotions are the basic element in the determination of a humanâ€™s cognitive abilities. These are the reaction of the human brain to internal or external events. Recognizing of different human emotions using a brain-machine interface is a crucial in understanding the emotional well-being of a patient who is completely paralyzed. One of the modalities for capturing neural activities in a brain-machine interface for recognizing human emotions is electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG-based systems for recognizing human emotions could offer a quick, simple, accessible, and user-friendly method for determining emotions. In the last few years emotion identification based on EEG has achieved significant attention. Many machine learning involved technologies have been developed for the classification of emotions of humans. Here we review the modern developments in the research area of emotion identification using deep learning methods, focusing on both feature extraction and classification methods. We also present the comparison of the accuracies obtained by different models. 	K. Sana Parveen, J. T. Panachakel, H. Ranjana, S. Sidharth and A. A.

2023-07-27	Emotion detection from EEG using transfer learning	2023 45th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)	In this study, we employed transfer learning to overcome the challenge of limited data availability in EEG-based emotion detection. The base model used in this study was Resnet50. Additionally, we employed a novel feature combination in EEG-based emotion detection. The input to the model was in the form of an image matrix, which comprised Mean Phase Coherence (MPC) and Magnitude Squared Coherence (MSC) in the upper-triangular and lower-triangular matrices, respectively. We further improved the technique by incorporating features obtained from the Differential Entropy (DE) into the diagonal. The dataset used in this study, SEED EEG (62 channel EEG), comprises three classes (Positive, Neutral, and Negative). We calculated both subject-independent and subject-dependent accuracy. The subject-dependent accuracy was obtained using a 10-fold cross-validation method and was 93.1%, while the subject-independent classification was performed by employing the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) strategy. The accuracy obtained in subject-independent classification was 71.6%. Both of these accuracies are at least twice better than the chance accuracy of classifying 3 classes. The study found the use of MSC and MPC in EEG-based emotion detection promising for emotion classification. The future scope of this work includes the use of data augmentation techniques, enhanced classifiers, and better features for emotion classification. 	S. Sidharth, A. A. Samuel, R. H, J. T.
