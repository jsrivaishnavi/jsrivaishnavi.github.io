Minimized interconnect parasitics, reduced pad sizes, and implemented interconnect traces on glass substrates, resulting in a 10X increase in throughput (1100 units per hour) and optimized tacking processes within 10 seconds.Ensured high mechanical and electrical reliability, and scalability for any silicon-interposer, applicable to advanced packaging constructs, dielet assembly on interposers, wafer-scale packaging, and high-performance computing applications.
Currently undergoing training on advanced manufacturing equipment, including Heidelberg Lithography, CHA Evaporation, Oxford ICP etcher, KLA Profilometer, and Nikon Microscope, to enhance technical skills.Developing proficiency in PPA equipment and mastering cleanroom gowning procedures as part of ongoing hands-on experience.
