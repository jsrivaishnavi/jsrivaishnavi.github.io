Designed an arithmetic digital model for Wallace Tree multiplier, known to be the fastest multiplier, using Kogge Stone Adders in place of traditional Carry Look Ahead Adders to record the efficiency and power consumption using \textbf{Verilog Hardware Description Language.
Implemented the algorithm on microprocessor Artix-7 FPGA to document the efficiency characteristics. Resulted in a faster algorithm with regular layout and a controlled fan-out of two. The delay of this structure is determined by log2(n), with [n(log_{2}(n))-n+1] computation nodes.
