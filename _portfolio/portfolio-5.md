Arithmetic Design: Implementation of Wallace Tree Multiplier : Designed an arithmetic digital model for Wallace Tree multiplier, known to be the fastest multiplier, using Kogge Stone Adders in place of traditional Carry Look Ahead Adders to record the efficiency and power consumption using \textbf{Verilog Hardware Description Language. Implemented the algorithm on microprocessor Artix-7 FPGA to document the efficiency characteristics. Resulted in a faster algorithm with regular layout and a controlled fan-out of two. The delay of this structure is determined by log2(n), with [n(log_{2}(n))-n+1] computation nodes.


Fingerprint Based Voting System using Arduino Nano : Innovated and deployed a fingerprint-authenticated voting model with Arduino Nano with GSM Module(SIM 900A), enhancing election security and real-time results; publication featured in the International Journal of Applied Engineering and Mathematics in 2023.

Skills : Verilog, Algorithm Design, VLSI Design,  Computer Arithmetic, ARM Programming, Python programming, Embedded systems
