Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) is a two-part course as a part of my Master's curriculum : a theoretical and a practical hands-on learning experince. The theoretical segment of this course discussed in detail the process flow including various types of procedures explaining lithography, wet and dry etching, physical and chemical vapour deposition, lift off etc from basics to the end testing. As for the practical part, I could put all of my theoretical knowledge into hands-on experience. The practical segment of this course is training the attendee to perform in an industry level cleanroom, here we practised all the cleanroom procedures including gowning, PPA and safety inspection. ALong with these, I was gaining hands-on experienec with UV lithography, spin coating, sputtering, rigirous piranha cleaning, wafer metrologe and finally 4-probe testing. 
Skills : Wet Etching, Dry Etching, Sputtering, Thermal Oxidation, Chemical Vapour Deposition, Failure Mode and Analysis, Probe Testing, Wafer Metrology, Optical Microscopy, UV Lithography, Contact Printing, Spin Coating
