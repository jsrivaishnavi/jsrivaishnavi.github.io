Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) is a two-part course as a part of my Master's curriculum: a theoretical and a practical hands-on learning experience. The theoretical segment of this course discussed in detail the process flow, including various types of procedures explaining lithography, wet and dry etching, physical and chemical vapor deposition, lift-off, etc., from basics to the end testing. As for the practical part, I could put all of my theoretical knowledge into hands-on experience. The practical segment of this course is training the attendee to perform in an industry-level cleanroom. Here, we practiced all the cleanroom procedures, including gowning, PPA, and safety inspection. Along with these, I gained hands-on experience with UV lithography, spin coating, sputtering, rigorous piranha cleaning, wafer metrology, and finally, 4-probe testing.

The end product that was fabricated and tested using 4-probe testing included a microchip with dimensions of 270um in diameter, which consisted of 40um, 20um, 10um, 5um NMOS; 40um, 20um, 10um, 5um PMOS; Al Resistor; Boron Resistor; Phosphorous Resistor; NAND; NOR; Capacitors; and CMOS Inverter. In summary, the process included six photomasks, five RCA Cleanings, two wet oxidation techniques, one dry oxidation technique, three pre-deposition techniques: one p-well, one p+, one n+, one drive-in, and one metallization technique.
