Bonsai refers to the Japanese art of growing miniature trees in small spaces. Bonsai takes time, patience, and dedication to learn, and many bonsai growers are looking for an easier and more effortless product to take care of their expensive plants. Due to the difficulty of bonsai care, a majority of owners will fail to meet their plants’ needs, and growers are willing to dedicate more resources to bonsai care because of their expensive nature. womEn have developed a product that
autonomously monitors a bonsai’s health and responds to its needs in real time. Our product is called the Eden Console.
Over the course of Winter Quarter, we have created a product which uses various sensors in a greenhouse environment to collect data on a bonsai’s health, and then responds with the resources (such as light, water, or nutrients) that the plant requires. This real-time system allows for responsive plant care with minimal user action. The Eden Console includes a website which allows users to monitor the current status of their plant and manually deliver resources at any time. The
website also hosts a database to show the plant’s health over time and observe growth trends.

Skills : System level interfacing, hardware implmentation, debugging, website development, sensors, microprocessor interfacing.
