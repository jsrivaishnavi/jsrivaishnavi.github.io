This project focuses on bird call classification and addresses the challenge of detecting multiple overlapping bird vocalizations. The proposed approach, called the 'Mel Graph-GCN' framework, first creates a graph from the mel-spectrogram of an audio file using a trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN). This graph is then inputted to a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) for classification. The algorithm's performance is evaluated using the Xeno-canto bird sound database and is compared against state-of-the-art models. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a macro F1-score of 0.85, outperforming existing approaches.
