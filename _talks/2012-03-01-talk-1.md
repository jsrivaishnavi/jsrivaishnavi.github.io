Description : The rapid growth of information technology has led to products where sensors, storage, processing, user interfaces, hardware, and connectivity are seamlessly integrated into miniaturized devices. However, the traditional Von Neumann architecture, with separate memory and computing units, faces high latency
and energy consumption due to data exchange between the units, known as the Von Neumann bottleneck. This is a significant drawback for enhanced computation, especially in larger systems where the gap between memory and CPU increases. One promising solution researcher have been actively working on to address these issues is integrating processing and data storage into a single unit, which is called computein-memory technology. Memory devices play a vital role in computer-in-memory technology. Unfortunately, existing memory technologies like SRAM, DRAM, and Flash, while successful, face their own challenges in operation and storage capabilities. For instance, DRAM capacitors struggle to keep up with transistor scaling due to leakage, and Flash scaling is limited by reliability problems from stacked layers and smaller transistors.Advanced storage technologies include resistive storage, ferroelectric storage, phase-change storage, and magnetic storage. Resistive storage, particularly resistive random-access memory (ReRAM), is a current research hotspot. ReRAM is considered crucial for advancing AI (Artificial Intelligence), big data, and meeting the high-speed and low-precision computing needs of IoT (Internet of Things) and neural network applications due to their non-volatile behavior, low-power consumption, and potential for high density implementation. Realization of high-density and reliable ReRAM is crucial for developing nextgeneration information storage and computing.
> Among various configurations, a crossbar design has received great interest due to their potential for high density memory cells. ReRAM cells are directly sandwiched between top and bottom electrodes and arranged as an array in a crossbar architecture which can achieve the smallest theoretical size of 4FÂ² by eliminating access transistors. The cross-array structure of ReRAM facilitates its fast calculation capabilities. Furthermore, employing a 3D structure can make resource-intensive tasks manageable and improve speed and energy efficiency for complex neural network models. Three-dimensional fabrication technology not only increases chip integration and reduces chip area but also enhances computing speed and enables new applications. Although a crossbar architecture is considered as one of the best architectures for very high-density memory cell design, it suffers from a sneak current between adjacent cells. This happens because unselected cells in a crossbar architecture are not completely isolated from the selected cells and small electric current can conduct through these unselected cells. In high-density memory architecture, these sneak currents account for a significant power loss and processing delay. This can be solved by adopting access transistors, but they also increase design and fabrication complexity significantly. In this research, I plan to develop ReRAM cells in a crossbar architecture to minimize sneak current without using access transistors. This can be achieved by isolating the resistive switching layer itself from the adjacent cells. Since conventional lithography is a very time-consuming process when achieving nanometric dimensions and wastes a lot of materials during the process, my research team proposes to use nanoimprint lithography (NIL) to create nano crossbar structures, ensuring faster production of nano crossbar ReRAM. Figure 1 illustrates the proposed fabrication process ReRAM memory devices are recognized as one of the most advanced and efficient emerging technologies, capable of providing higher densities. Nanolithography is employed to achieve precise dimensions more quickly and effectively. Integrating nanoimprint lithography (NIL) into the proposed fabrication process ensures high precision, resulting in finely structured ReRAM that operates at peak performance by reducing the sneak current. This approach improves the manufacturing process's accuracy, enabling ReRAM to reach its full potential
