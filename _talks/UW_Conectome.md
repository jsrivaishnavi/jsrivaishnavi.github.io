Description : We proposed a binary pain states classification pipeline which involved power in band values as features and usage of CSP to discriminate the two pain states followed by Random Forest Classifier to classify the pain states. The best validation accuracy obtained was 77.5% when trained with number of estimators = 41. The future direction involved gathering more patients from the data and identifying specific regions of the brain and frequency band associated with the chronic pain.
