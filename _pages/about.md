I am a first year master's student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle. I reveived my bachelor's in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from College of Engineering Trivandrum.

My research interests broadly lie in audio/speech processing, computational neuroscience, and machine learning.

In University of Washington, I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Jeffrey Herron](https://sites.uw.edu/jeffherr/) in [Neural Systems lab](https://neural.cs.washington.edu) where I work alongside [Vishwas Sathish](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ad01nlUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Samantha Sun](https://samantha-sun.com) on identifying potential biomarker for pain from electrophysiological signals. I am also a part of [Mobile Intelligence lab](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/) where I work on developing a foundational model for spatial audio alongside [Malek Itani](https://malekitani.github.io) and [Dr. Shyam Gollakota](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/). 

Prior to joining University of Washington, I was a research intern at the [Learning and Extraction of Acoustic Patterns (LEAP) lab](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in) where I worked alongside [Dr. Sriram Ganapathy](http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/) on the [DISPLACE 2023 Challenge](https://displace2023.github.io).
