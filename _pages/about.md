I am a first year master's student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, Bothell. I reveived my bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from G. Narayanamma Institute of Technology.

My research interests lie in microfabrication and ReRAM memory device optimization.

In University of Washington, I am fortunate to be working with [Dr. Seungkeun Choi](https://www.uwb.edu/stem/faculty/em-faculty/schoi) in [Choi Research Group](http://faculty.washington.edu/schoi5/) where I work on optimization of fabrication process for ReRAM crossbar array. I am also a part of [EMiT Lab](https://emitlab.ece.uw.edu) where we are working on developing an optical DAC based transmitter within a Silicon Integrated Fabric(SiF) 3D package, which is being fabricated on-site at the Washington Fabrication Facility alongside [Dr. Sajjad Moazeni](https://people.ece.uw.edu/moazeni_sajjad/).
