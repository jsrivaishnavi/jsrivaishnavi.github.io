I am a first year master's student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle. I reveived my bachelor's in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from College of Engineering Trivandrum.

My research interests broadly lie in audio/speech processing, computational neuroscience, and machine learning.

In University of Washington, I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Jeffrey Herron](https://sites.uw.edu/jeffherr/) in [Neural Systems lab](https://neural.cs.washington.edu) where I work alongside [Vishwas Sathish](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ad01nlUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Samantha Sun](https://samantha-sun.com) on identifying potential biomarker for pain from electrophysiological signals. I am also a part of [Mobile Intelligence lab](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/) where I work on developing a foundational model for spatial audio alongside [Malek Itani](https://malekitani.github.io) and [Dr. Shyam Gollakota](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/). 

Prior to joining University of Washington, I was a research intern at the [Learning and Extraction of Acoustic Patterns (LEAP) lab](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in) where I worked alongside [Dr. Sriram Ganapathy](http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/) on the [DISPLACE 2023 Challenge](https://displace2023.github.io).


## News

**June 18, 2024**  
I'm thrilled to announce that I've accepted an offer to join BrainChip as a Machine Learning Engineering Intern. I'll be starting this exciting journey on June 27, 2024. Looking forward to contributing to innovative projects and advancing my skills in neuromorphic computing and machine learning.

**May 13, 2024**  
I will be presenting a poster at UW CoNectome on our research work on identifying neural biomarkers of pain using a statistical approach. The event will take place at Zillow Commons in the Gates Center. If you're interested in learning more about our work, please feel free to drop by the poster presentation, 5/13.
